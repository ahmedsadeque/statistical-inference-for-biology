Technological changes in biomedical research drive data production in greater quantity and complexity. High-throughput technologies produce data whose size and complexity require sophisticated statistical skills to avoid being fooled by patterns arising by chance. In the past researchers would measure, for example, the transcription levels of a single gene of interest. Now it is possible to measure all 20,000+ human genes at once. Advances such as these have brought about a shift from hypothesis to discovery-driven research. However, this has greatly elevated the importance of statistics and data analysis in the life sciences.   
This lesson will introduce the statistical concepts and data analysis skills needed for success in data-driven life science research. We start with one of the most important topics in statistics and in the life sciences: statistical inference. Inference is the use of probability to learn population characteristic from data. A typical example is deciphering if two groups (for example, cases versus controls) are different on average. Specific topics covered include p-values, the t-test, confidence intervals, association tests, permutation tests and statistical power. We make use of approximations made possible by mathematical theory, such as the Central Limit Theorem, as well as techniques made possible by modern computing. We will learn how to compute p-values and confidence intervals and implement basic data analyses.
